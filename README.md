---Insert Neon Impulse 2D title here---

This is a repository for Neon Impulse 2D, a 2D Action-Adventure Pinball game created for a Game Programming capstone project at Humber College.
Development for the project initially started fall 2022 and this current playable capstone demo version of the game build was completed in April 2023.
The developers behind this project will continue to work on this project, and hope to release a fully playable demo build in the near future.
